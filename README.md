# Data Visualization

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks demonstrating different types of **data visualizations** using Python libraries such as **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly**. Each notebook explores a dataset with a variety of plots, where the figure sizes (`plt.figure(figsize=(...))`) are set to ensure clear and spacious visualizations.
